The 100 Hills Club - among other questionable ideas - was born during one of our regular meet-ups at a local coffee shop. We built it in the hopes
that other people would be inspired to join us in running the amazing hills of the Quad Cities.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
If you enjoy the 100 hills club consider <a href="https://www.paypal.me/n8nt"><b>buying us a coffee</b></a>. Your contribution will help keep the
 lights on so that others can be a part of the club. Who knows? You might buy the coffee that results in the next great idea.
